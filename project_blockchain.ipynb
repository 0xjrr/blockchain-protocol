    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this document, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, focusing on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and the Merkle Tree data structure that underpins the blockchain's transactional integrity. We'll implement these concepts in Python and examine their role in maintaining the security and integrity of a blockchain."

    "## Proof of Work (PoW)\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks to achieve agreement on the state of the network. It involves solving a computationally intensive puzzle to validate transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. PoW is used in popular blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "Imagine you're a miner, and you want to add a block to the blockchain. The block includes a bunch of transactions, and your job is to find a special number called a \"nonce\" that, when combined with other block data, produces a specific pattern when hashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Nonce\n",
    "- You start with the block's data, including the transactions and a previous block's hash.\n",
    "- You also pick a random number called a nonce and combine it with the block's data.\n",
    "- Next, you use a computer to hash this combined data. A hash is like a fingerprint for data – it's unique to each set of data.\n",
    "- If the resulting hash doesn't match the required pattern (usually starting with a certain number of zeros), you try another nonce and repeat the process.\n",
    "- You keep trying different nonces until you find one that produces a hash with the required pattern.\n",
    "### Why It's Important\n",
    "The PoW puzzle is intentionally difficult and time-consuming to solve, but verifying the solution is easy. This ensures that adding a block to the blockchain requires real computational work, making it expensive for someone to tamper with the blockchain's history, but easy for others to verify the work."

    "\n",
    "However, with a Merkle Tree, the proof of inclusion for a transaction requires providing only a subset of hashes from the tree, known as the Merkle path. This path consists of hashes of sibling nodes along the path from the transaction's leaf node to the root of the tree.\n",
